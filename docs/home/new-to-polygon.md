## What is Polygon

Polygon is the world’s largest blockchain ecosystem, providing the best solutions for scaling Ethereum. Starting from its groundbreaking POS, a successful EVM-enabled sidechain, Polygon entirely shifted to a Multichain paradigm, backed up by Zero-Knowledge oriented protocols, ZkEVM and Miden, a decentralized identity system, Polygon ID  and an App-chains building service, Supernets.

## The Role of Polygon in the Web3 Ecosystem

Polygon envisions a future where everyone can have self-sovereignty and privacy in an increasingly collaborative environment. For that, Polygon offers solutions that focus on Security, Scalability and Interoperability. Through an open and transparent perspective, Polygon aims to provide Innovation for all networks and communities.

The technical challenge Polygon proposes to solve is to scale Ethereum, overcoming its limitations, such as high gas fees, poor user experience and slow transaction time. Adding to that, Polygon aims to tackle the issue of interoperability and interconnection between networks, enabling a novel Internet of Blockchains where all instances of the Web3 space can interact with each other in a seamless manner.

:::info Blockchain and Web3

Web 3.0 or Web3 represents a paradigm shift from the hitherto centralized network for a new perspective of a decentralized set of computers.

The first version of the Web enabled the global expansion of the internet with static websites providing not much interaction but rife with easily accessible information. Next, Web2 came with a promise of pervasive interaction and personalized content creation. However, with many issues in Web2, such as illegal data collection and sharing, as well as failures in centralized servers resulting in dire consequences, there has been an urge for a new paradigm.

Web3 is the immediate response to Web2’s known vices: the lack of data transparency and the excessive centralization of the network. Trust is a real concern, in a scenario where only a few large corporations control private information and decide how it is shared in the network. One of the ideas behind Web3 is to move the power away from the big tech company, whose algorithms, for instance, actually decide what kind of information is to be shared with their clients at the user’s hand.

**Web3 revolves around some crucial concepts, which are usually part of the Web3 industry parlance, such as trust, ownership, permissionless, blockchain and many others.** The ultimate goal of this new paradigm is to generate a new internet that follows these principles and establish innovative digital communication and social activity.

## Benefits of Polygon

What makes Polygon one of the most crucial projects in the blockchain industry? It is the idea that Polygon solutions and protocols represent the next step in the industry, grounded on continuous research and development.

Here are some of the cornerstones of Polygon technology:

- Interoperability

Polygon aims to solve siloed blockchains, where the exchange of data between networks is not prioritized and transferring tokens from one blockchain to another is a complex feature. In fact, Pos bridge, a cross-chain approach and an integrative mindset are the real enablers of interoperability.

- Scalability

Polygon’s inception was based on scaling Ethereum. Now, it follows a more robust goal: upgrading the blockchain. In order to achieve such a challenge, Polygon applies one of the most groundbreaking protocols of cryptography: zero knowledge. This technology ushers in an era of fast throughput and an overall better experience with blockchain products.

- Security

Polygon’s protocols and solutions leverage Ethereum’s security. As a pioneer layer 1 network, Ethereum’s security has been thoroughly tested out and it serves well to develop layer 2 solutions that inherit such an efficient paradigm.

- Dev friendliness

Developing on Polygon should be an accessible experience. Aside from a constantly updated wiki, Polygon’s personnel plays an important role in assisting builders: the team is always reachable in the Polygon Discord channels, as well as other social networks. Developers, DevRels, and Support team; these people are always there to improve your developer experience.

- Governance PIP

As a community-driven protocol, Polygon offers the possibility of anyone having a say about its future. PIPs, Polygon improvement proposals, work as a resource where the Web3 community can suggest changes to Polygon protocols.

:::info A brief history of Polygon

In 2017*,* the Matic network was created by JD Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal and Anurag Arjun as a  way of providing a solution to the blockchain’s scalability problem and solving Ethereum issues, such as long processing time and high gas fees. Polygon’s technology at the time was focused on the Plasma framework and the Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm and implementation, where validators play a major role.

At the beginning of 2021, Matic became Polygon Technology and shifted its focus to a more interconnective perspective. The current tendency of Polygon is to establish itself as a Multichain provider, that supports and bridges major blockchains with their intrinsic characteristics and provides solutions for a wealth of blockchain use cases.

## Polygon solutions

### POS
POS is a Proof-of-Stake scaling solution for Ethereum-based public blockchain network, which enables the use of sidechains. As POS offers low gas fees and fast TPS, this solution is ideal for creating decentralized services, applications and finance. It also supports the creation and issue of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and game development.

### zkEVM
Polygon zkEVM is a scaling solution equivalent to the Ethereum Virtual Machine that leverages cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to offer validity and quick finality to off-chain transaction computation. NFT, Gamefi, and Enterprise applications might benefit from Polygon’s low gas cost, high transactions, and a greater level of security coupled with Ethereum composability. For digital payment, zkEVM enables near-instantaneous and low-fee real-time transactions.

### Supernets
Polygon Supernets is a customizable, modular, and extensible end-to-end service to build and power dedicated, highly robust and forward-compatible application-specific blockchains. Supernets provide premium support to help users build blockchains avoiding the complexity of blockchain development and the difficulty of maintaining its infrastructure.

### Miden
Polygon Miden is a zero-knowledge virtual machine. The design decisions taken in Miden’s development process allow developers to create applications currently difficult and impractical on account-based systems. It uses  STARK-based proof of execution to be used by anyone to verify that the program was executed correctly without the need for re-executing the program or even knowing its content.

### Polygon ID
Polygon ID makes it possible to build trusted and secure relationships between users and dApps, following the principles of self-sovereign identity (SSI) and privacy by default. Organizations can issue verifiable credentials about users, and other individuals can verify those claims via a suite of tools created for each member of the SSI ecosystem.
It uses zero-knowledge proofs so that users can prove their identity without having to expose their private data.
